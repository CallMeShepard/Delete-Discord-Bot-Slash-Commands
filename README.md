Python code that will allow you to easily delete/view all or specific slash commands from your Discord application

# ⚠️Please note⚠️
If you remove slash commands from your bot, they will disappear on every server where the bot is added.
\nThis means that in order for new commands to appear, you need to re-add the bot to the server.

\n\nAlso, by viewing the source code, you can make sure that your bot token and application ID that you enter are safe and are not sent anywhere without your knowledge.
