Python code that will allow you to easily delete/view all or specific slash commands from your Discord application

# ⚠️Please note⚠️
If you remove slash commands from a bot, they will disappear on every server where the bot is added. This means that in order for new commands to appear that can be added to it, you need to re-add the bot to the server.
